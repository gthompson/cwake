To install this trial AVO seismic analyst review environment (ASARE) on your Unix/Linux computer, there are X steps:

1. If you're using the bash shell, add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:

	# Directory to which the AVO Seismic Analyst Review Environment will be installed
	export ASARE=$HOME/avo_analyst_review_workspace 
	# Append ASARE bin directory to system PATH
	export PATH=$ASARE/bin:$PATH
	# Append ASARE pf directory to Antelope parameter file path
	export PFPATH=$PFPATH:$ASARE/pf

   $ASARE is the directory in which you intend to do all your AVO seismic analyst review work. You can choose a different directory name if you wish.

   (If you're using the cshrc shell, then your file is ~/.cshrc and you need to use "setenv" in the line above, in place of "export").

2. After editing the .bashrc file (or .cshrc file) update your shell variables by sourcing it:
	source ~/.bashrc

3. If the $ASARE directory already exists, delete it:
	rm -r $ASARE

   It will probably require confirmation for the annoying .svn directories which SVN puts everywhere.

4. Download a read-only copy of the SVN repository with the command:
	svn checkout http://avo-analyst-review.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ $ASARE
