If the velocity models defined here seem odd, it is because they are designed to replicate those that already existed in hypoellipse as used by AVO. 
Specifically, it implements the velocity models and cylinders defined in crustral.prm and cyl.dly.
These cylinders are described in the appendix of any "Catalog of Earthquake Hypocenters at Alaska Volcanoes" - though apparently not accurately.
For example, there is actually no cylinder for Fourpeaked. But there are cylinders for Shishaldin and Westdahl.
In Hypoellipse, wherever a velocity model had not been determined for a specific volcano, one from another volcano was substituted, or a regional
"south of 62.5 degrees" model was used.
The tables "regions" and "regmodel" exist only to enable use of ttregions, which will look up the correct region to use, and select the appropriate
velocity model. However, ttregions (in Antelope contrib) is not working at this time. Therefore genloc has to be told which velocity model to use
- by the user via dbloc2, or by parameter file if using relocate or orbgenloc.
