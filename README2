This is CWAKE - the Common Workspace for AlasKa Earthquakes

Description:
------------

CWAKE is an Antelope configuration that allows any researcher or analyst to process Alaska earthquakes using the same velocity models, regions and local magnitude as used by the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

Requirements: (skip these if you have Antelope & svn on your system)
-------------
1. You need to have a computer running Antelope version 5.0-64. To see if Antelope is installed on your system, type:
        echo $ANTELOPE
You should see something like:
	/opt/antelope/5.0-64

If you do not have Antelope on your computer, you might be able to get it from IRIS if you are at a university or other educational program in North America.

If you only have an earlier version of Antelope, you can still use CWAKE, but there may be some things that don't work.

2. It is helpful to have an up-to-date copy of antelope contrib. The best way to keep contrib up-to-date is the use the instructions at: https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib/wiki/Cloning-the-git-repository-of-Antelope-contributed-code
Ask you system administrator to do this. (S)he will first need to install git. If git is not an option, your administrator can pull the latest tarball following the instructions at: https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib/wiki/Downloading-the-Antelope-contributed-code

3. You will need to have svn installed on your computer. Simply type "svn" at the command line to see if it is installed. If it isn't, talk to your system administrator. 

Installation:
-------------
1. Decide where you want to install CWAKE. Here we assume you will install it at $HOME/work/cwake. DON'T CREATE THIS DIRECTORY YET! We will do that when we use svn checkout below.
2. Change to parent directory where you plan to install CWAKE. In the example above this is $HOME/cwake.
	cd $HOME/cwake 
3. Download (checkout) your local copy (a svn "sandbox") of the CWAKE svn repository from Google Code:
	svn checkout http://cwake.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cwake
You should now see several new directories, including bin (containing executable code), pf (parameter files) and rc (Unix resource files), tables/genloc (a local copy of the AVO genloc database, containing velocity models and regions)
4. Change to the cwake directory:
	cd cwake
5. Run the cwake install script - this will add a line to your shell rc file if you are using bash or cshrc.
	bin/install.pl
6. If the installer completed successfully, you should now be able to open a new command window and then type:
	cwake
This should change to the cwake directory, and source the cwake.rc file, adding paths to system variables important to Antelope, telling it for example to use the pf files in the cwake directory, and the AVO genloc database in tables/genloc.
7. To test if cwake works, run dbloc2 on the demo database provided.
	dbloc2 -r 6. If the installer completed successfully, you should now be able to open a new command window and then type:
	cwake
This should change to the cwake directory, and source the cwake.rc file, adding paths to system variables important to Antelope, telling it for example to use the pf files in the cwake directory, and the AVO genloc database in tables/genloc.
7. To test if cwake works, run dbloc2 on the demo database provided.
	dbloc2 -r 6. If the installer completed successfully, you should now be able to open a new command window and then type:
	cwake
This should change to the cwake directory, and source the cwake.rc file, adding paths to system variables important to Antelope, telling it for example to use the pf files in the cwake directory, and the AVO genloc database in tables/genloc.
7. To test if cwake works, run dbloc2 on the demo database provided.
	dbloc2 -r 6. If the installer completed successfully, you should now be able to open a new command window and then type:
	cwake
This should change to the cwake directory, and source the cwake.rc file, adding paths to system variables important to Antelope, telling it for example to use the pf files in the cwake directory, and the AVO genloc database in tables/genloc.
7. To test if cwake works, run dbloc2 on the demo database provided.
	dbloc2 -r 6. If the installer completed successfully, you should now be able to open a new command window and then type:
	cwake
This should change to the cwake directory, and source the cwake.rc file, adding paths to system variables important to Antelope, telling it for example to use the pf files in the cwake directory, and the AVO genloc database in tables/genloc.
7. To test if cwake works, run dbloc2 on the demo database provided.
	dbloc2 -r 6. If the installer completed successfully, you should now be able to open a new command window and then type:
	cwake
This should change to the cwake directory, and source the cwake.rc file, adding paths to system variables important to Antelope, telling it for example to use the pf files in the cwake directory, and the AVO genloc database in tables/genloc.
The practical upshot is that when you want your standard Antelope settings, just open a new command window and work as normal. When you want the cwake settings, type "cwake" (or source ~/.bashrc if you're using bash, source .cshrc if you're using csh) and then you have a workspace that mirrors the configuration at AVO.
7. To test if cwake works, run dbloc2 on the demo database provided.
	dbloc2 -r demo/demodb
Try and locate an event and/or compute its magnitude.
